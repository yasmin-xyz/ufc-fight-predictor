          <p className="meth-lead">
            Pick&apos;em Labs is a sports analytics tool that combines publicly
            available fighter statistics, live sportsbook odds, and independent
            analysis from multiple AI models. This page explains exactly how
            predictions are generated, what data is used, and where the current
            limitations are.

            For every fight on an upcoming card, Pick&apos;em Labs pulls three
            independent inputs and combines them into a single analysis view.

                  Three AI models — Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini — independently
                  evaluate the matchup using fighter statistics and odds context.
                  Each model produces a predicted winner, a confidence score,
                  and a structured breakdown covering key advantages, risks, and
                  a likely fight script.

            model receives the same structured prompt containing fighter
            statistics and odds data. They analyse the matchup independently —
            no model sees another&apos;s output before producing its prediction.

          <p className="meth-body">
            Each AI model returns a confidence score between 0 and 100
            alongside its predicted winner. This score represents the
            model&apos;s self-assessed certainty in its own prediction given
            the data it was provided.

          <p className="meth-body">
            The consensus confidence shown in the Multi-Model Consensus panel
            is the arithmetic average of the three individual model scores. It
            is not a probability of the predicted fighter winning — it is a
            measure of how certain the models are collectively in their pick.
          </p>
          <p className="meth-body">
            A high consensus confidence combined with a pick that disagrees
            with the betting market is typically the most analytically
            interesting signal Pick&apos;em Labs surfaces.

            The Value Analysis panel compares the AI consensus win probability
            against the market-implied probability derived from sportsbook odds.

            edge.
          </p>
          <p className="meth-body">
            A positive value edge means the AI models collectively assign a
            higher win probability to a fighter than the market does. A
            negative value edge means the market is more confident in that
            fighter than the AI models are.

          <p className="meth-body">
            Pick&apos;em Labs is an early-stage tool. There are several known

              <span className="meth-limitation-label">Statistical recency</span>
              Fighter statistics reflect career averages. Recent form, injuries,
              coaching changes, and camp reports are not systematically
              incorporated into the data layer.
            </li>
            <li className="meth-limitation">
              <span className="meth-limitation-label">AI knowledge cutoffs</span>
              Large language models have training cutoffs. Fights, results, and
              fighter developments that occurred after a model&apos;s cutoff date
              may not be reflected in its analysis.

            <li className="meth-limitation">
              <span className="meth-limitation-label">No fight-by-fight granularity</span>
              The current data layer uses aggregate career statistics rather
              than round-by-round or fight-by-fight breakdowns. Stylistic
              trends that have emerged recently may not be captured.

              AI model outputs are not deterministic. The same prompt may
              produce slightly different predictions across separate requests.
              Predictions should be treated as one analytical input, not a
              definitive forecast.
